            <h3>What is Tales of Wedding Rings about?</h3>
            <p>
              Satou and his best friend, Hime, have been together for as long as
              he can remember. So when she tells him she’s going back to her
              home world to get married, his first thought is to follow her and
              crash her wedding.
            </p>
            <p>
              All goes according to plan, and with a kiss from Hime herself,
              Satou becomes the new groom. But unbeknownst to Satou, the man who
              marries Hime is destined to be a hero of immense power and save
              the world! Is Satou up for the challenge, or is this just too much
              responsibility for one high schooler to handle?

              Even though he is deemed a threat by society for his lack of
              magical powers, Mash Burnedead refuses to be underestimated.
              Living in secrecy in the forest, he dedicates himself to training
              his physical abilities to rival those who possess supernatural
              abilities. But when his hidden identity is uncovered and his
              peaceful existence is put in jeopardy, Mash sets off on a quest to
              become a "Divine Visionary" - a highly esteemed status that would
              force society to recognize his worth. To safeguard his sanity,
              Mash enrolls in the renowned Easton Magic Academy - competing with
              the offspring of the most powerful and affluent families in the
              land. Without the crucial skill of magic that is necessary to
              thrive in the institution, Mash seems to be at a significant
              disadvantage compared to his peers. Nevertheless, Mash is driven
              to triumph and will use his physical prowess to break through
              magical barriers and claim the coveted title of Divine Visionary.

            <p>
              Despite his ordinary appearance as a typical middle school
              student, Kyoutaro Ichikawa nourishes a sinister craving for
              committing murder. Specifically, his mind is fixated on
              terminating Anna Yamada, his class's admired icon, a thought that
              persists in his psyche. Unexpectedly bumping into Yamada while
              absorbed in reading at the school library, Ichikawa is amazed.
              Yamada sneaks in to binge on sweet treats, unaware of her
              surroundings. As they start spending time together, Ichikawa finds
              Yamada's lack of common sense amusing and feels compelled to
              bolster her from the sidelines. At the same time, Yamada relishes
              in humiliating Ichikawa, frequently mocking him. Their daily
              interactions gradually deepen their relationship and create an
              unbreakable bond that exceeds their initial library encounter.
              Perhaps with time, Ichikawa will realize that his homicidal
              impulses have transmuted into something far more valuable.

              for his bravery, he was deemed hideous by the world's goddess and

              realm, Makoto found himself surrounded by a variety of fantastical
              creatures, including dragons, spiders, orcs, and dwarves. Despite
              the perilous conditions, he discovered that his talent for magic
              and combat far surpassed anything he had achieved in his previous
              life. As he navigated through a series of dangerous encounters,
              Makoto struggled to survive in a world where even the gods had
              abandoned him. This is the story of his quest to forge a new life
